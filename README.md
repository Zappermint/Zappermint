<h2>What is Zappermint?</h2>
We are an adless revenue platform. We strive to rid the mobile app industry of ruining our user experience with the unskippable horrors, known as ads.
Through staking yield, we offer app developers an alternative revenue model that allows them to build apps with a user experience that they intended to build.

<h2>Strength in numbers</h2>
Zappermint's ecosystem is designed to work better the bigger our user base. Invite your friends with the links below, hype them up and get them aboard!

      <h3>Quinten Wuyts - Co-Founder & CTO</h3>
      With only 23 years of existence, Quinten is a whiz kid when it comes to writing code and thinking of how software systems should work. If he was a soccer player he would play Champions League. He can architect like no other and there are no secrets when it comes to c#, javascript, jquery, html, css, nodejs, solidity, python...<br/><br/><br/>

      <h3>Yassine Abid - Co-Founder & CCO</h3>
      Yassine once tried to combine all his hobbies into one. Dribbling a football up a rock face was fine, but his 'digital canvas' was too heavy to take with him. Yassine has 10 year experience in marketing and business model canvas design and has a high interest in new innovative ways to disrupt industries. He juggles seamlessly with social media and can communicate like no other.

      <h3>Robbert Van Strydonck - Advisor</h3>
      Robbert is here for all the legal mumbo jumbo. Itâ€™s the stuff he dreams of, but that the average user seldom reads, let alone understands. As a lawyer he is driven by his pen and can write razor-sharp conclusions. He invites you to read our legal documents but they basically state that we promise to never screw you over, sell your info or do anything else to compromise our integrity. In turn, we expect you to play fair and stick to our terms.
